There are limited data regarding efficacy of beta blockers in males with long QT syndrome type 3 (S7.9.1.1-3,S7.9.1.1-35,S7.9.1.1-36) but, in selected patients, beta blockers can be protective against SCA (S7.9.1.1-36,S7.9.1.1-37). Several observational studies have reported effectiveness for risk reduction in long QT syndrome with propranolol, atenolol, and nadolol with appropriate dosing (S7.9.1.1-26,S7.9.1.1-28,S7.9.1.1-38-S7.9.1.1-40), while metoprolol appears less effective (S7.9.1.1-41). RCTs to assess comparative efficacy of specific beta blockers are unavailable, although many centers favor the use of nadolol. For long QT syndrome type 1, 1 study reported atenolol reduced risk of VA while nadolol was not associated with risk reduction (S7.9.1.1-2). For long QT syndrome type 2, nadolol was reported to show superior efficacy (S7.9.1.1-1,S7.9.1.1-2). Patients receiving a beta blocker should undergo ongoing monitoring to assess changes in QTc over time, and adequacy of beta blockade with exertion (S7.9.1.1-26,S7.9.1.1-28).",

			"Mexiletine is an additional medication that can be used in patients with long QT syndrome and recurrent ICD shocks. Left cardiac sympathetic denervation is associated with a reduction the number of appropriate ICD shocks and VA burden (S7.9.1.1-13-S7.9.1.1-16). Reduction of the QTc to &lt;500 ms after left cardiac sympathetic denervation has been correlated with reduced risk of recurrent ICD shocks and frequency of symptoms (S7.9.1.1-16,S7.9.1.1-52); however, SCD or SCA is reported in 3% to 10% of patients (S7.9.1.1-15,S7.9.1.1-16,S7.9.1.1-48,S7.9.1.1-50). Although arrhythmia burden is often reduced, up to 27% of high-risk patients experience at least 1 recurrence (S7.9.1.1-13,S7.9.1.1-14,S7.9.1.1-48). Patient outcomes are improved if the left cardiac sympathetic denervation is performed in centers with surgical expertise in this procedure. Use of additional medications is guided by long QT syndrome type. In long QT syndrome type 3, ranolazine, mexiletine, and flecainide shorten the QTc and have been used to reduce recurrent arrhythmias (S7.9.1.1-6,S7.9.1.1-7,S7.9.1.1-10).",

Women with long QT syndrome type 2 are at a higher risk of postpartum cardiac arrest/SCD (S7.9.1.1-42,S7.9.1.1-43) and should receive prepregnancy counseling. Patients with long QT syndrome and recurrent syncope while receiving a beta blocker have an increased risk of SCA or appropriate ICD shocks (S7.9.1.1-9) and escalation of therapy is warranted to prevent SCD. Earlier studies reported benefit of antibradycardia pacing, with recurrent syncope or cardiac arrest reported in 7% to 24% of patients (S7.9.1.1-44-S7.9.1.1-47). In high-risk patients, observational studies support effectiveness of the ICD in preventing SCD, with consideration of left cardiac sympathetic denervation to reduce the frequency of ICD shocks (S7.9.1.1-16,S7.9.1.1-48,S7.9.1.1-49). Left cardiac sympathetic denervation can reduce VA burden, but up to 27% of high-risk patients experience at least 1 recurrence (S7.9.1.1-16,S7.9.1.1-48,S7.9.1.1-50). Left cardiac sympathetic denervation may be more effective in patients with long QT syndrome type 1 and long QT syndrome type 3 (S7.9.1.1-16). Complications related to left cardiac sympathetic denervation occur in 8% to 20% of patients (S7.9.1.1-48,S7.9.1.1-51). Syncope in patients with long QT syndrome may occur due to vasovagal syncope, noncompliance with medications, or proarrhythmia from concurrent medications (S7.9.1.1-5). Clinical evaluation that incorporates consideration of genotype, QTc interval, medication compliance, and shared decision-making regarding the need to change or escalate therapy is important. Use of additional medications is guided by long QT syndrome type. In long QT syndrome type 3 ranolazine, mexiletine, and flecainide shorten the QTc and have been used to reduce recurrent arrhythmias (S7.9.1.1-6,S7.9.1.1-7,S7.9.1.1-10).",

			"In a prospective, observational study of patients with suspected long QT syndrome, patients with a history of syncope or cardiac arrest and either an affected first-degree relative or a borderline or prolonged QTc interval underwent exercise treadmill testing and bicycle exercise, with ECGs recorded before, during, and after exercise, as well as in different positions (S7.9.1.1-27). long QT syndrome was confirmed by genetic testing in all affected individuals. Among patients with borderline-to-normal resting QTc intervals, prolongation of the 4-minute recovery QTc ≥445 ms had high sensitivity for correctly identifying patients with long QT syndrome (S7.9.1.1-27). A study in younger patients demonstrated QTc prolongation &gt;460 ms at 7 minutes of recovery predicted long QT syndrome type 1 or long QT syndrome type 2 patients versus controls (S7.9.1.1-23). In a study using burst bicycle exercise, patients with latent long QT syndrome had a significantly greater increase in QTc with exercise than either controls or those with QTc prolongation at baseline (S7.9.1.1-24). These findings can be useful in establishing whether long QT syndrome is present. Monitoring adequacy of beta-blocker therapy using exercise testing can be beneficial, particularly in school-aged patients (S7.9.1.1-26,S7.9.1.1-28). Beta-blocker therapy may be associated with a decrease in supine and peak exercise QTc, with the exception of long QT syndrome type 1 patients with C-loop mutations (S7.9.1.1-25).",

			"Approximately 10% to 36% of genotype-positive patients with long QT syndrome have QTc intervals ≤440 ms, most commonly patients with long QT syndrome type 1 (S7.9.1.1-31,S7.9.1.1-35). Patients with long QT syndrome and normal QTc have a lower risk of VA and SCD compared to those with prolonged QTc (S7.9.1.1-35), but still have an increased risk of SCA or SCD compared with genotype-negative, age- and sex-matched general patients (S7.9.1.1-31). Beta blockers reduce the risk of adverse cardiac events substantially (S7.9.1.1-1-S7.9.1.1-5,S7.9.1.1-30,S7.9.1.1-36,S7.9.1.1-38,S7.9.1.1-41,S7.9.1.1-57). During the periods of highest risk in the first 3 decades of life (S7.9.1.1-11,S7.9.1.1-18), treatment with a beta blocker may reduce risk of SCA (S7.9.1.1-26,S7.9.1.1-28,S7.9.1.1-36,S7.9.1.1-38). Changes in QTc occur over time, particularly during puberty and during and after pregnancy, indicating the need for assessment of QTc on ECG annually or with medication changes, and assessing medication efficacy with exercise testing as feasible. Asymptomatic adult (male) long QT syndrome patients with normal QTc intervals may choose to decline beta-blocker therapy (S7.9.1.1-11,S7.9.1.1-34).",

			"The risk of adverse cardiac events from VA is influenced by the patient&#39;s resting QTc interval, age, sex, and long QT syndrome genotype/mutation. For asymptomatic males with long QT syndrome, the risk of cardiac events is highest in childhood (S7.9.1.1-2,S7.9.1.1-8,S7.9.1.1-11,S7.9.1.1-30), during a time when medication compliance is challenging. Young women with LQT2 and QTc &gt;500 ms are at increased risk of SCA (S7.9.1.1-2,S7.9.1.1-11,S7.9.1.1-18-S7.9.1.1-20,S7.9.1.1-30,S7.9.1.1-35) especially in the 9 months postpartum, and may be candidates for primary prevention ICD placement or use of a wearable cardioverter-defibrillator (S7.9.1.1-30).",

QT-prolonging medications (www.crediblemeds.org) (S7.9.1.1-59) should not be used in patients with long QT syndrome unless there is no suitable alternative; careful monitoring of the QTc during therapy is recommended, with consideration for discontinuing therapy with marked QTc prolongation. Concurrent use of stimulant or nonstimulant attention deficit/hyperactivity medications was associated with an increased risk of syncope/cardiac arrest in long QT syndrome, particularly males, in 1 study (S7.9.1.1-34), but it did not appear to be associated with increased risk in another retrospective study (S7.9.1.1-60). Episodes of torsades de pointes can be precipitated by exposure to a QT prolonging medication, or hypokalemia induced by diuretics or gastrointestinal illness. Attention to maintaining normal potassium and magnesium balance when medications or situations that promote depletion are encountered is an important component of management. Rare case reports exist of fever prolonging the QT interval in patients with long QT syndrome type 2; fever should be reduced with antipyretics (S7.9.1.1-61)(Table 10).",
